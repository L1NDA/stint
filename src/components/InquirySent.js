              Your money is safe in our holdings for now. Weâ€™ve notified the student about your request, and weâ€™ll get back to you with their response within 24 hours.

            <p>To encourage fair compensation for student work, students can negotiate for a pay amendment one time if they believe they deserve a higher wage than what is offered. Weâ€™ll notify you if this is the case.
              <br/> <br/>
              Once the student accepts your offer, work begins! After the first project quarter is up, we will begin to transfer the studentâ€™s payment to their bank account at the agreed upon hourly wage, including their pay for the first quarter.
              <br/> <br/>
              If youâ€™re not happy with the studentâ€™s work, no worries! Just let us know before the first quarter is up, and weâ€™ll refund you in full.
